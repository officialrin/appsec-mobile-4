In CardInterface.kt, the problem is that the api only takes the card number of the giftcard.
There is no sort of verification of card ownership or other details.
This is a vulnerability because with only a number, a malicious user could use a card that does not belong to them.
To verify the giftcard owner or purchaser, the api should also take the authorization token when buying the card with the card number so that the card owner can be verified.
